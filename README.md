EarthWorks is a community earth system model that strives to provide high-resolution climate-scale simulations. This work leverages and extends the [Community Earth System Model](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM) where possible to allow coupled runs of Atmosphere, Land, and Ocean components on a single grid with horizontal spacing (cell size) less than 4km.
